# Roadmap

This document provides a high level roadmap for Tinkerbell development and
upcoming releases. Community and contributor involvement is vital for the
success of implementing the desired items for each release. We hope that the
items listed below inspire engagement from the community to keeping Tinkerbell
progressing and shipping exciting and valuable features.

_The format below is `[version - theme](milestone link)`._

## [v0.1 - Public Debut](https://github.com/tinkerbell/tink/releases/tag/v0.1.0)

## [v0.2 - Installers](https://github.com/tinkerbell/tink/releases/tag/v0.1.0)

## Future

This items listed below can be used to get a general idea of the features that
are important to the community and what we are planning. We use the
[milestone](https://github.com/tinkerbell/tink/milestones) feature in Github, so
look there for the most up-to-date and issue plan.

Each roadmap item should link to open issues or
[proposals](https://github.com/tinkerbell/proposals) that describe the feature
and set forth a plan.

Pull requests that fulfill or expand the roadmap should include a separate
commit updating this file. Acknowledging roadmap updates is part of the [pull
request
checklist](https://github.com/tinkerbell/.github/blob/master/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md#checklist).

_The items listed below do not represent a timeline of commitments._
